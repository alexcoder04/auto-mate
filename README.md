## Warning: Work in Progress!!!

Modern automation framework for the Linux Desktop.

## About

This is going to become an automation framework specifically targeting the Linux Desktop.

The backend (found in this repository) watches for different types of events (file created, battery at certain level, incoming mail, etc)
and runs user-defined series of actions (show notification, turn wifi off, send mail, etc).

A frontend (not made yet) provides a graphical configuration tool inspired by iOS Shortcuts,
which allows users to create automations without the need of writing shell or other type of scripts.
